# Mk.12 High Voltage BMS

Firmware for the Mk.12 High Voltage Battery Management System. Runs on an STM32 G474RE leveraging FreeRTOS and the ADBMS6830 IC Library.

## FEATURES

- Reads cell voltage and auxiliary measurements from ADBMS6830 battery monitor ICs.
- Computes pack voltage, temperatures, current, state of charge, and fault conditions.
- Manages BMS operating states including idle, GUI wait, charging, balancing, precharge, drive, and fault states.
- Controls charging behavior for an Elcon charger and J1772 plug interface.
- Performs cell balancing through the ADBMS6830 PWM discharge controls.
- Publishes BMS telemetry over CAN and can optionally emit JSON-style GUI/debug output.
